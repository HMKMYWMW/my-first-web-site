        <p>JavaScript ( English : JavaScript ) is an object-based script programming language . This language is mainly used within the web browser and has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as a runtime environment such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation , first under the name Mocha and later under the name LiveScript, and finally became JavaScript. Although JavaScript has similarities in syntax with Sun Microsystems ' Java , this is actually because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language , and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Aside from the name and syntax , it has more similarities to Self and Scheme than to Java .
